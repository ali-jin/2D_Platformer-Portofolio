## Introduction
Rain's Memories is a 2D game platformer made in Unity. You play the role of a young girl that wake up in this world, and you have to collect all the shards to move on to the next level. The project is a unique pixel art game in a world that is always raining, where you may fight enemies to advance in the level, and is very challenging.

The project was made in 4 weeks by the only developer of the project, [Alina Jin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alina-jin-475276254/?originalSubdomain=fr).
